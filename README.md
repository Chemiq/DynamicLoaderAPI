DynamicLoaderAPI
================

Tibia client and server API that extends gameplay capabilities on stock tibia client. It simply loads light weight dynamic libary (.dll) to tibia process memory as main controller. It also have overlay (DX9 only atm) which can give many things like a custom windows (you can create quest window etc.) or even custom mini games. Server will get lua functions that will control it all. You can use it on normal server making for example some areas that will only need it. 

I think it is good idea to start this project coz do not all people want to make they ots with otclient for example. Here they can just expand it for additional textures or make own customs (all tibia files will stay unchanged).
